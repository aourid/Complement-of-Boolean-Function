# Complement-of-Boolean-Function

 The idea here is to use the Unate Recursive Paradigm (URP) to determine a complement of a Boolean function $F$. 
 For that, we use the complement version of Shannon's expansion version.
 This is similar to the idea to determine *Tautology* for a boolean function using URP.
 The function $F$ is represented by Positional Cube Notation (PCN) cube list in a file. The complement code returns 
 a new boolean function $\overline{F}$ as a PCN cube list as well.
